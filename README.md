# calibre-doc-input-libreoffice

Calibre plugin that makes docs searchable via Calibre full text search.

## Description

The plugin enables Calibre internally to read and process doc files. The original doc in the user library remains unchanged. This is a fork of [igieon/calibre-doc-input](https://github.com/igieon/calibre-doc-input).

2.  Change the location of LibreOffice in Calibre > settings > input options > doc input (if you're soffice.exe is not located in "C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program\soffice.exe")

### Changes

If you want to change the source you can download the src folder, zip it (so that the files are at top level) & add it to Calibre.
